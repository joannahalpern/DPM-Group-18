Skeleton of our Capture the flag project.

Everything is initialized in the Controller class. The main method is also in Controller.

Note that to use the colour sensors, you call getColourValue() from the instance of the LightPoller.
	For example: lsPollerLeft.getMedian(); will give you the median colour value
Same idea for the ultrasonic sensor. You don't call the sensor itself, rather the UltrasonicPoller
	For example: usPoller.getDistance();
