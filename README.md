DPM-Group-18
============
To use the bluetooth, just start ProjectW14Server_2 which is located in CodeVersion8.
Note that our NXT Name is TEAM18. You first need to turn on the robot and run the 
Controller program. Then, input all of the values on the computer program, press start,
and wait a while for it to connect. And that's it! 
Also know that it works on Nancy's laptop.

FYI, To open RConsole, goto: C:\Program Files (x86)\leJOS NXJ\bin\nxjconsoleviewer
For more info message me or checkout https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKFnqk2eQM8. Also,
the current code to work from now is CodeVersion3.4

---------------------------------
When you want to write/change code, use CodeVersion3.2_Nav_Odo or the latest version
of CodeVersion3 to start and add to that. Navigation and Odometer are working
right now (but not perfectly).

Also, the main method is in the Controller class but you should use the main method in
the Testing folder with the class your working on. For example, to run localization,
you should run LocalizationTest and write the code where it says PUT CODE HERE.

Message me if you have any questions and good luck!
